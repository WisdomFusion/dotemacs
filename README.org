* About

My .emacs.d configration, structured as an org-mode file.

* Requirement

- GNU Emacs 24
- Mac OS X, Windows XP or later

* Installation

Git clone or just download and exract files to ~/.emacs.d/ folder, and restart your Emacs.

All of the configration is written in config.org using org-babel blocks, e.g:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl)
#+END_SRC

* How it works

Using org-babel, which is part of org-mode.

The code in init.el invokes org-babel functiion org-babel-load-file, which will generate a config.el file and executes it immediately.
