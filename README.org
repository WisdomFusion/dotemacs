* About

My .emacs.d configration, structured as an [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file.

* Requirement

- GNU Emacs 24 or later
- Mac OS X; *nix; Windows XP or later
- install CLISP and slime before turn on slime on in init.el

* Installation

Git clone or just download and exract files to *~/.emacs.d/* folder, and restart your Emacs.

All of the configration is written in *config.org* using [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] blocks, e.g:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl)
#+END_SRC

* How it works

Using [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]], which is part of [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].

The code in init.el invokes [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] function org-babel-load-file, which will generate a config.el file and executes it immediately.
